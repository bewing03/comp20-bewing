# NotUber

## This page uses the navigator.geolocation object in Javascript to determine the location of the user and sends the data to a datastore API with passenger and vehicle info using an XMLHttpRequest POST route. 

## The returning .JSON string is parsed and the other users are displayed on the map. 

## Clicking on any marker displays the username of the vehicle or passenger and the distance in miles between the user and the marker.

## Distance was calculated using the Haversine formula provided at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript.
