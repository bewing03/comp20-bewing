## This is the GitHub repository for my work in COMP20 at Tufts University. It contains several lab assignments as well as 3 main assignments

## My favorite assignment was the notuber assignment number 2. I enjoyed learning the Google maps API and learning how databases work. I also enjoyed designing the layout of the home page of that assignment.

## I have grown a lot in terms of learning how to use the resources provided online to teach myself how to use different frameworks and technologies. Before this class, I needed to have things really laid out for me, but I was able to use the links provided online to teach myself the things I needed to know be able to complete the assignments

## The most important thing I learned was the importance of web security, not just in order to protect my projects from cyber attacks but also how valuable that knowledge could be in a job interview. It was not something I had ever really considered before this class and learning about it really opened my eyes to how impactful protecting data is. 

## I would like to delve deeper into HTML/CSS/Javascript/JQuery to learn how to make better looking interfaces and design things how I want them to look. In this class we just learned all the fundamentals so now I have the tools to go on an learn how to make webpages look how I want them too.
